I'm terrible at navigating St. John's so I decided to create a brief [directory](https://danielledonnelly.github.io/chill-places/) of locations for myself.

This is just my personal list based ofF of the chill places that I've either already visited or have been recommended. 

I define a "chill place" as somewhere I can comfortably read, work remotely, or code.
