# CHILL PLACES
## I'm still learning to navigate St. John's so I decided to create a brief [directory](https://danielledonnelly.github.io/chill-places/) of locations for myself.
✦ Just a list of chill places to go that I made for myself
✦ I define a "chill place" as somewhere I can comfortably read, work remotely, or code
✦ Not much else to say, just used this as an excuse to practice using Bootstrap
