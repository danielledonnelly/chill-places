# [CHILL PLACES](https://danielledonnelly.github.io/chill-places/)
## I'm still learning to navigate St. John's so I decided to make a directory for myself.
✦ Just a simple list of chill places to go 
<br>✦ I define a "chill place" as somewhere I can comfortably read, work remotely, or code
<br>✦ Not much else to say, just used this as an excuse to practice using Bootstrap
