# CHILL PLACES
## I'm still learning to navigate St. John's so I decided to make [directory](https://danielledonnelly.github.io/chill-places/) of places for myself.
✦ Just a simple list of chill places to go 
✦ I define a "chill place" as somewhere I can comfortably read, work remotely, or code
✦ Not much else to say, just used this as an excuse to practice using Bootstrap
